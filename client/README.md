# Elm starter

## Starter template for Elm project

This is a little setup I use whenever I quickly want to get started with a new
Elm project. 

The goal is to provide a minimal setup ~~without any~~ with minimal dependencies.
Unlike many other setups you don't need Node/npm to get started.

It **does come** with a [watch script](/bin/watch.sh) to continously compile the app.
It **does not come** with a server. It **does not come** with a CSS preprocessor.
It **does come** with [Pico.css](https://github.com/picocss/pico) to get started with some
basic styling.
