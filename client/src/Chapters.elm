Welcome to Chapter 1, where we dive into the essentials of displaying content
through HTML. 

Here's the key takeaway: web browsers are designed primarily to
showcase documents. 

Their special knack? Fetching these documents from remote
servers. 

Now, what's inside these documents? Well, they're written in a unique
language called HTML. 

HTML uses **tags** â€“ special markers â€“ to outline
content structure. However, HTML isn't concerned with
presentation; it's all about organizing the content's framework. 

HTML is not a _"real"_ programming lanugage because it can't **"do"** things.
For example you can't use HTML to calculate things.

In the upcoming lessons we're going to learn the basics of how to write a HTML document by hand
so the browser is able to display it.
