To be able to understand the jargon around web apps we need to get familiar with names developers
use for certain concepts.

## Elements and tags

A `HTML` document is made up of **elements**. For example an element to display a paragraph is called just `p`
and looks like this:

```html
<p>some text</p>
```

The `p` with it surrounding pointy brackets are called tags. So an element is composed of

- an _opening_ tag (`<p>`)
- it content (here the text `some text`)
- and a _closing_ tag (`</p>` - note the extra slash `/`)

## Trees and the DOM

The content of an element cannot only be text but also other elements ðŸ¤¯!
When we put elements into other elements we call that _nesting_.

When we _nest_ a lot of elements, and we think of the outer as "bigger" elements, while the
inner ones get smaller and we squint a lot, we get why computer scientists like to call
the resulting structure a tree.

This specific tree as it can be contructed from HTML elements is officially also called The
[Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).

In the editor on the right is a minimal example of a tree of elements forming a DOM.
HTML is the DOM that the browser is made to display.

Click "run" to see how the browser diplays this `HTML` document in the bottom right panel.

Here is an image showing how the nested elements can be thought of as "branches" of a tree.
